ðŸ’¡ UI / Navigation Improvements You Could Consider

Here are some practical ideas based on your current Pug + Bootstrap setup:

ðŸ§­ 1. Unified Navbar Component

Move your current header/navbar logic into components/navbar.pug.

Highlight the active page using the route (e.g., /lists, /calculators, /account).

Optionally, make it responsive (Bootstrapâ€™s navbar collapse already helps).

ðŸŽ¨ 2. Consistent Theming

Add a light/dark toggle (Bootstrap 5.3 supports data-bs-theme natively).

Use CSS variables or SCSS to give the site a distinct color identity (still within Skyblockâ€™s aesthetic).

ðŸ§© 3. Sidebar for Tools/Checklists

For pages with lots of subtools (like calculators or lists), add a sidebar navigation.

This helps users move between related sections quickly.

ðŸª¶ 4. Footer Improvements

Include version info or changelog links.

Add social/Discord buttons with icons from Bootstrap Icons
