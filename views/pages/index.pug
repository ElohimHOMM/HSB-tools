      p Welcome to Skyblock Tools. This is a website written by, so far, one person. It started out as just a 
        | way for me to keep track of what I have crafted already (e.g. sacks) and what I'm still missing.
      p If you have any feature requests or ideas, let me know in the Discord, which you can find at the 
        | bottom of every page.
      p My goal is to have every important tool united under one roof, with calculators, checklists, 
        | progression and many more. Of course to reach that goal, I need a lot of help and third party 
        | resources, which will be updated in the Reference section.
      p Special Thanks to everyone helping out with this project. Here are some infos regarding the server 
        | costs: Currently domain, webhosting and certificates cost me around 80 Euros a year.
      b We are in no way, shape or form affiliated with Hypixel. This is a purely fan made project.
